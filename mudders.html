												<p>The Kentucky Mudders call Louisville Kentucky and the KFC Yum! Center home. The Louisville community is the 16th largest market in the NBA with a population including Jefferson County of 741,096 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Through innovative and technologically enhanced marketing strategies the Mudders organization expects to be one of the top organizations in the NBA in attendance, fan identification, entertainment value, and brand equity.</p>

												<br>
												<a name="industry"> <h2 style=" background-color: #00ADEE;">INDUSTRY ANALYSIS</h2></a><br/>
												<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the premier basketball organization in the United States and the World. With International television deals in 212 countries and translated in over 42 languages. NBA.com can be found in many international forms including, Africa, Brazil, Canada, Spanish, France, German, Greece, Italian, India, China, Japan, Arabic, United Kingdom, and the Philippines. According to Bernard Mullin, Stephen Hardy, and William Sutton some surveys conducted in 2003 suggested that among China’s one plus billion people, basketball was more popular than soccer. In the last decade the NBA has become one of the most profitable and marketable sports in the world.</p>
												<p>The National Basketball Association was founded in 1949 with the combination of the National Basketball League (NBL) and the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In
												1948 several teams left the NBL and formed the BAA, this organization lasted only one season before the NBA was formed. The Association now consists of 30 teams in six divisions, Atlantic, Central, Southeast, Northwest, Pacific, and Southwest, divided into two conferences, East and West as seen in Table 1. The Kentucky Mudders are in the Eastern Conference Central division. Other teams in this division include the Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons and, Indianapolis Pacers. The NBA has television contracts with ESPN, ABC, and TNT in the United States and international agreements in
												212 countries. The NBA has an 82 game regular season followed by a 16 team playoff
												system in a best of seven series in the 2-2-1-1-1 format except for the NBA finals which are in a 2-3-2 format. The regular season schedule consists of at least four games with every team in that team’s conference and at least two games with each team from the opposite conference.</p>
												<p>In 1984 David Stern took over as the commissioner of the NBA and worked to change the image of the NBA from drug scandals and labor strife to international phenomenon in the 1990s. In the last 21 years 8 different teams have won the NBA championship with three teams winning three consecutive series in that time frame. This shows a marginalization in the NBA especially for a new team in a smaller market. According to the 2010 population estimates the average population for a NBA championship city is 1.6 million people. The average population of the Eastern Conference Central Division is 1.04 million. If you eliminate the outlier in Chicago whose population is
												2.69 million people the mean drops to 632,500 individuals per Central Division City. The
												NBA has diverse audience in many different sized markets which provides a strong level of competition.</p><br>

Bloomington, IN is not being targeted as the population is within one hour of driving from Indianapolis, IN where the Indiana Pacers call home. The three areas being targeted by Louisville Mudders advertising, promotion, and sponsorship have over one million people that are potential Mudders fans.</p>
												<a name="louisville"> <h3 style=" background-color: #00CCFF;">OVERVIEW OF LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY</h3></a><br/><p>Louisville is the largest city in the state of Kentucky with approximately 741,096 individuals in the metropolitan area (University of Louisville Urban & Public Affairs, 2011). It is also a major sports hub, featuring the University of Louisville, a 20,000 student institution, Churchill Downs, the home of the 137 year old Kentucky Derby, and the Louisville Bats, the Cincinnati Reds Triple A affiliate (University of Louisville, 2011). The University of Louisville is the oldest city supported college in the United States. (City of Louisville, KY, 2011). Louisville is known as the “Possibility City” according to the Louisville city government and The Greater Louisville Community Branding Project. Louisville is:
												<blockquote>
												  <p>“Somewhere between “anything goes” and “feels like home.” This isn’t just "a place to live," it’s a place to really live. It’s a town without excuses, blissfully free of the hang-ups and holdups that keep things from happening. It’s a place where blue-sky thinking meets grassroots can-do. It’s a city without limits. Anything’s possible here in Louisville. Especially you” (The Greater Louisville Community Branding Project, 2011).</p>
												</blockquote>
												The city was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark and is named for King Louis XVI of France. Louis XVI was an avid supporter of the American Revolution but was executed in 1793 during the French Revolution.</p>
												<p>Louisville is the largest city in the State of Kentucky and the 27th largest in the United States (Pearson Education Inc., 2011). In 2003 Louisville became the first metropolitan city in 30 years to merge its city and county government (Advameg Inc., 2009). Louisville is almost twice as large as Lexington, also in the Mudders marketing radius, which has an approximate population of 295, 803. Kentucky’s state capital Frankfort, is the fourth smallest state capital in the United States with an approximate population of 49, 285 (Briney, 2010).</p>
												<p>For much of Kentucky’s history the state has been a hub for mining and agriculture. Louisville has had a more diversified economy with its location on the Ohio River. This location has provided the city with the ability to create transportable goods in the way of automobiles and other manufactured goods. Yum! Brands and Humana Inc. call Louisville home and other large corporations like Ford and General Electric have manufacturing plants in the city metro area. Tourism is the second largest private employer in the state (Louisville Convention & Visitors Bureau, 2011). Some of the attractions in the Louisville area are: The Kentucky Derby, which has been held for the last 137 years and is the first leg of the Triple Crown in thoroughbred horse racing. Fourth Street Live is a section of 4th street in downtown Louisville contained under an open air roof with live music, restaurants, and shopping. The Kentucky International Convention Center and The Kentucky Center hold conventions year round and attract a wide variety of organizations. Also available are the Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory and the Louisville Science center.</p>

												<a name="promotions"><h2 style=" background-color: #00ADEE;">MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS</h2></a><br>
												<p>The Kentucky Mudders marketing strategy includes five different opportunities, Product, Price, Place, Promotion, and Public Relations. The goal of this marketing strategy is to be all encompassing of these individual opportunities while being efficient and effective. The Kentucky Mudders organizations will use the Radio, Television, Print, and Internet mediums to market the team as well as engaging and interactive promotions to acquire and retain fans of the organization.</p>
												<a name="marketing"> <h3 style=" background-color: #00CCFF;">5 P'S OF MARKETING</h3></a><br/>
												<h5><u>Product</u></h5>
												<p>The Kentucky Mudders Product is the entertainment and material merchandise of a professional basketball contest in the National Basketball Association. The entertainment offered is in the game day atmosphere including in arena music, cheerleaders, mascot, promotions, and the contest itself. The sale of merchandise in the form of souvenirs as well as food is also part of the Kentucky Mudders product.</p>
												<h5><u>Price</u></h5>
												<p>The Kentucky Mudders Pricing strategy will ensure competitiveness with other local sports while remaining at a premium in comparison. The local competition is mainly University of Louisville Athletics which conducts basketball contests at the KFC Yum! Center as well. The price of a U of L Men’s Basketball ticket is $35 for individual tickets sales in the 300 level or the Upper Bowl. Kentucky Mudders tickets range from $10 to $50 in the same seating area as seen in Table 8. While it is important to be competitive in your own market you must also be comparable to the national market to ensure that your revenue from ticket sales and merchandise allows you to continue to place a competitive product on the floor in the actual basketball contest and the in-arena entertainment.</p>
												<h5><u>Place</u></h5>
												<p>The Kentucky Mudders place in the marketing mix is, both, the arena and its advertising media outlets. The term “place” has a broad definition in the sports marketing mix in that it asks how visible your organization in its place of business, in the community, and in terms of advertising outlets. The KFC Yum! Center is where the consumption of the Mudders product takes place in entirety. That is not to say that the consumption of the product does not occur elsewhere. Those who consume the Mudders product outside of the KFC Yum! Center are only consuming the radio and or television broadcast and do not get to enjoy the in-arena atmosphere, promotions, or other entertainment that is provided in the Kentucky Mudders production. There are other aspects of the place in the marketing mixes which have been identified. These include the television, radio, print, and web based marketing outlets. These outlets have been identified previously and are the best chance for the Kentucky Mudders organization to reach the broadest population and bring in new and non-consumers and media only consumers.</p>
												<h5><u>Promotion</u></h5>
												<p>The Kentucky Mudders promotional strategy will focus on a three part strategy of technology first, community relations, and entertainment value. Focusing on these three points will help show what the Kentucky Mudders organization has to offer the community and non-consumers and media users. The first strategy is showing how the Mudders are a technology forward organization. As identified previously the Mudders Social Lounge and Social Media seats will be an innovative way of offering a new way to connect with the Mudders and help the community. All heads of departments, athletes, coaching staff and media personnel will be encouraged to use the technologies and interact with our fans in an effort to create a bond and establish positive brand equity. The second focus of the promotional strategy is in our community relations. Along with the NBA Cares and the NBA/WNBA FIT program the Mudders organization will help rebuild the community and help the Louisville youth get active. There are many areas of the Louisville community in economic and physical distress. Playgrounds and housing units need repair and rebuilding. The Kentucky Mudders organization along with the NBA’s FIT program will work with local schools to develop youth basketball programs to their fullest potential (NBA, 2011). The final focus of the promotional strategy is in the entertainment value offered each and every home game by the Kentucky Mudders and the KFC Yum! Center staff. The value is in not only the pricing but the place and product being offered. Showcasing these aspects in our advertising, marketing, and our promotional material will allow the Mudders to establish the positive brand equity being strived to achieve.</p>
												<h5><u>Public Relations</u></h5>
												<p>The Kentucky Mudders will handle all public relations matters in house that include day-to-day transactions, events, sponsorships, promotions, and community relations. The VP of Public Relations will have the ability to hire a staff of efficient size to control and design the message in both a media and consumer relations standpoint. For all public relations matters that could be considered a “crisis” such as illegal activity and or tragedies, an outside crisis management firm will be employed. Some of the top firms to choose from include Levick Strategic Communications based in Washington D.C. and Edelman who holds offices worldwide including Chicago the closest to the Louisville Area. Using these public relations strategies the Kentucky Mudders organization will be able to communicate in an effective manner.</p>
												<a name="efforts"> <h3 style=" background-color: #00CCFF;">Marketing Efforts</h3></a><br/>
												<p>In a partnership with Yum! Brands, the Kentucky Mudders will have a unique ability to market the local Louisville population through their restaurants and with various events sponsored and produced by Yum! Brands. Based in Louisville Kentucky, Yum! Brands is the world’s largest restaurant company in terms of system restaurants with nearly 38,000 restaurants in 110 countries. This partnership is beneficial for both groups and is expected to help build brand equity for the Kentucky Mudders and bring excitement and entertainment to Yum! Brands.</p>

When working with radio broadcasting rights the Kentucky Mudders will retain the rights to the broadcast of Mudders basketball contests. The Mudders will join into a partnership with Clear Channel Communications Inc. Radio, Fox Sports Network Television, and both the Gannett Company and the McClatchy Company for broadsheet newspaper advertising and coverage.</p>

												<h5><u>Radio</u></h5>
												<p>As seen above in Table 6 the media in the Louisville, Lexington, and Cincinnati areas provide a broad coverage of the Kentucky Mudders and the everyday activities. With both AM and FM radio stations providing coverage there is the opportunity to reach a broad audience and build brand equity. The Kentucky Mudders radio network will broadcast all 82 regular season games and every pre-season contest as well. There will be a half hour Call to Post Pre-Game show airing simultaneously on all three stations prior to tip-off of every contest. The stations will then air the contest in its entirety. After each contest, the Mudders Finish Line Post-Game show will air. Each week, the head coach of the Mudders will answer caller’s questions along with the host on the Coaches Corner show.</p>
												<h5><u>Television</u></h5>
												<p>With the combination of Fox Sports Ohio and Fox Sports South, the Kentucky Mudders have the opportunity to reach audiences throughout the Ohio River Valley. Fox Sports will air every contest unless specified by the NBA’s television agreement with national TV Networks; TNT, ESPN, and ABC. There will be a half hour Pre-Game show on the television side of broadcasts as well. Television is the most visible medium and is therefore very important for any sports organization to focus a large portion of advertising efforts into. Creating game promotional material to air on the local television channels will allow, aware non-consumers and media consumers to be intrigued towards attending a contest and climbing the escalator. As seen below, the Kentucky Mudders plan to spend $2.4 million in television advertising. This is more than three times the amount spent on radio advertising. Even when the production costs are factored in, the difference is still significant. The importance of television advertising is reflected in the amount spent to gain more active consumers to the Kentucky Mudders family.</p>
												<h5><u>Print</u></h5>
												<p>The Kentucky Mudders will advertise and focus cooperation with three major newspapers in the Ohio River Valley as seen in Table 6. While being connected with the Louisville, KY community, it is important to focus the majority of its media relations with The Courier Journal. Approximately a third of the print advertisement and media relations budget will be used towards, both, The Lexington Herald-Leader and The Cincinnati Enquirer. While print based advertising, in the way of newspaper, is a declining form of media, it is still an integral part of the marketing of a large organization. Another form of print based advertising is with the Louisville Magazine which focuses on the interesting and entertaining aspects of Louisville Kentucky. Louisville Magazine has an average monthly circulation of 24,000 copies (loumag.com, 2011).</p>
												<h5><u>Internet</u></h5>
												<p>The Internet is an ever-growing medium that reaches three out of four Americans, on average (Nielson, 2004). This medium will be an integral aspect of the marketing strategy of The Kentucky Mudders. One website that the Kentucky Mudders will need to develop a partnership with is Louisville.com, a hub for all events and entertainment in the Louisville, KY metropolitan area since 1996. With new technologies being created every day it will be important to utilize each one of these and engage our fans through the internet to help create a special bond between fan and organization. Most if not all of these technologies are free to use and offer premium features for large corporations to engage their fans in more inventive ways. Some of the web technologies that will be used are Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, YouTube, FourSquare, Yelp, and a new emerging technology ThingLink. The most intriguing of these technologies is ThingLink which is an interactive hotspot you define inside an image (thinglink.com, 2011). The other technologies offer ways to communicate and interact with fans in the way of providing news, conducting surveys, and offering loyalty rewards. This medium is extremely important in this information age and this can be seen in the amount being invested in these technologies.</p>

												<p>The Kentucky Mudders organization along with NBA Sponsors and the NBA Cares initiative will identify charities and sponsors with common goals. With these organizations identified the Mudders will establish a working partnership to advance the marketing and community interaction of the Kentucky Mudders organization. These prospective sponsors will be presented with packages so that both organizations can increase sales and gain brand equity through the working partnership being created.</p>

												<p>The Kentucky Mudders will offer new promotional seating to advocate the technology first attitude for this seasons play. Two areas will be designated one behind the Mudders bench for two individuals each game and one in a suite opposite of the Mudders bench. These areas will be seated by an application process to fans that show their fanaticism towards the Mudders and their use of social media. Recently the Cleveland Indians, Major League Baseball team in a similar sized market, began offering a free gift to six fans and a guest to use one of their suites (Kenworthy, 2011). The Indians use an application process to identify fans for this promotion. Fans are not provided with food or beverages like normal suites but are allowed to purchase them. “In return, the team gets is marketed to the thousands of people who are connected to the 12 people in the suite through social media” (Kenworthy, 2011). This concept is an innovative way to bring fans into the game and feel a connection to the Mudders while receiving free publicity.</p>
												<p>The Kentucky Mudders will offer one fan and a guest who are already in attendance
												the chance to upgrade to the social media seats behind the Mudders bench. All the fans will
												need to do is use a specific Twitter Hash Tag or Facebook Check In shown on the digital
												signing inside the arena each night to be considered. This will be a sponsored promotion by
												the Kentucky Mudders Charity Foundation and for every post by these individuals $10
												dollars will be donated to one of the prearranged charities. This promotion could easily
												raise $50,000 for Mudders Charities throughout the season.</p>
												<p>The Mudders will also sponsor the Mudders Social Lounge where six fans and a
												guest will be able to apply for spots in the new suite. The suite will be Wi-Fi enabled and
												these fans will be offered parking, tickets to the game, as well as concessions sponsored by
												Yum! Brands. This will be a great way to show that the Kentucky Mudders are a technology
												first organization offering new ways to connect with friends, the organization, and our
												athletes.</p>

												<h5><u>Strengths</u></h5>
												<p>The strengths of the Kentucky Mudders are in the production quality, local partnerships, entertainment value, and freshness of the brand in the community. The production of every Mudders contest focuses on a fun, family friendly experience with a competitive product each and every night. With an arena that opened in 2010 there is a unique opportunity to establish a high energy advanced product for the fans in the arena. The local partnerships with the Yum! Brands will be an integral strength of the Kentucky Mudders organization. As described earlier in the promotional strategy the entertainment value of the Mudders is in a three stage approach which includes the technology forward approach, high production quality, and amazing facility. The final strength identified is in the freshness of the Kentucky Mudders brand in the Louisville community. This gives the organization the unique ability to define and establish the Mudders brand equity from the ground up.</p>
												<h5><u>Weaknesses</u></h5>
												<p>Two of the main weaknesses that the Kentucky Mudders organization will struggle with include the current perception of the athletes involved and not having an established brand in the community. In the past several years many athletes have been accused of extra-legal and extra marital affairs while averaging a larger salary than any other sport per individual according to a Fox Sports article. Researchers identified the NBA players as earning an average $4.79 million each year (News Core, 2011). With such a wage gap between the average individual and the amount of negative publicity this is a weakness to the Kentucky Mudders and NBA brand. The other weakness identified is the lack of an established brand in the Louisville community. This has been established as both as a strength and as a weakness due in part to the ability to make a first impression but also the inability to have a strong fan-base to work from and grow. The Kentucky Mudders will need to work hard to overcome these weaknesses and become a successful organization.</p>
												<h5><u>Oppurtunities</u></h5>
												<p>The Kentucky Mudders organization has several opportunities to grow as an organization in the Louisville community, the NBA brand, and as a high quality product. The opportunities for the Mudders organization are having a new arena, the population age of the community and being in a new locale. The first opportunity is that the KFC Yum! Center is only in its second year of operation providing the fans a state of the art experience in comfort and style. This is an opportunity to promote and focus much of the Mudders marketing strategy toward. Another opportunity to the Kentucky Mudders is in the age of the population of Louisville and Jefferson County. As reported earlier the median age is 37.9 years of age with 268,036 people between the age of 18 and 45. This is a big population to focus the Kentucky Mudders marketing towards. The final opportunity as mentioned previously is in the first impression the organization has the opportunity to create. This is the first and most important chance to establish the organization within the community.</p>
												<h5><u>Threats</u></h5>
												<p>There are many threats to the Kentucky Mudders organization some of these threats are listed below. All of these threats are events or places of interest for individuals to visit and spend their time and money. There are also threats in national sports that will draw the Louisville population away from the Mudders. Some of these include sporting events, television shows, and movies. All of these threats will need to be addressed and will be competition for the Kentucky Mudders.</p>
